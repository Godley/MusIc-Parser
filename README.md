# MuseParse
Repository for a python music parser. This works with MusicXML as the input format which forms a tree of objects in memory representing the piece. This can be optionally outputted to lilypond which produces a PDF, or perused for your own uses. Written for python 3 only, python 2.7 support may come later but I'm not intending on doing that unless everything else is done.
Originally written as part of my Final Year Project (or dissertation project) at university. I earned 93% on this so you'd hope it was good.

# Installation
I'm hoping to put this on pypi, but at the minute all you need to do until then is run the usual setup commands:
``` 
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
```

# Usage
To get the music parser:
To send it to lilypond:
To provide the lilypond runner class with your own lilypond script:
